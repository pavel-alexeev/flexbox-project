              <h3>1. WHAT KIND OF SHOES SHOULD I WEAR HIKING?</h3>
              <p>
                To determine what kind of shoes you need for hiking you need to
                consider how much weight you plan on carrying and what the trail
                conditions are like. It also comes down to your personal
                preference, some people just aren’t comfortable wearing heavy
                hiking boots. It’s something you’ll figure out as you go, but
                here’s some guidelines to give you a place to start:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For <span>day hikes</span>, hiking shoes or trail running shoes
                are best. Since you aren’t carrying a heavy backpack, boots are
                overkill.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For <span>multi day hikes</span>, mid cut boots and full boots
                are the best option. These will help support your ankles. Having
                said that, if you have strong leg muscles, you can probably get
                away with wearing hiking shoes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For <span>multi day expedition treks</span> with tough trails
                and bad weather, those heavy duty, waterproof boots come in
                handy. They’ll support your feet and ankles while carrying a
                heavy back and help you grip on rough terrain.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-section reverse">
            <div class="faq-image-container">
              <img src="images/faq2.jpg" alt="Hike" />
            </div>
            <div class="faq-qanda">
              <h3>2. WHAT CLOTHES ARE GOOD FOR HIKING?</h3>
              <p>
                This also is dependent on the weather. For hiking, it’s best to
                dress in layers, that way you’re never too hot or too cold.
                Basically you’ll want a thermal layer on the core, an insulating
                layer like a fleece for around camp and a waterproof outer layer
                to protect you from the rain and wind. As far as materials go,
                merino wool and synthetic fibers are the best options.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>
                3. EVERY TIME I’VE TRIED HIKING I END UP GETTING BLISTERS, HOW
                DO I PREVENT THEM?
              </h3>
              <p>
                It’s much easier to prevent blisters then have to deal with
                treating them. If you have new shoes make sure to break them in,
                you can do this by going on a shorter trail before taking on a
                big one. A little trick you can use for multi day hikes is to
                rub a light layer of vaseline on your feet before you put your
                socks on in the morning. This helps prevent your socks from
                rubbing and creating a blister.

              <h3>4. HOW DO I STAY DRY WHILE HIKING?</h3>
              <p>
                To stay dry while hiking be sure to carry a good quality, fully
                waterproof rain jacket and rain pants. Fully waterproof clothes
                have a breathable liner and seam sealed zips. If they don’t have
                these two features, it’s water resistant not waterproof. It’s
                also important to keep your backpack dry so you don’t arrive to
                camp with wet clothes and a wet sleeping bag. We recommend
                putting your sleeping bag in a dry bag and using a pack cover
                (which fits around you backpack). Another option is to use a
                pack liner, which is a bag that you first put in your backpack
                then pack everything inside that bag.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>
                5. I’M OUT OF SHAPE & NOT FIT ENOUGH TO HIKE FOR LONG HOURS,
                WHERE SHOULD I START?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The best way to get in shape for hiking is to get out on the
                trails. Start small, you don’t want to just jump right to the
                toughest trail and end up hating hiking. Perhaps, look at doing
                a local trail that’s relatively flat, one that you could tackle
                in an hour or so on the weekends.
